The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974. He based
it on the Latin word fractus which means "broken" or "fractured".
A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which pattern
remains the same at every scale.
Various natural phenomena – like the romanesco cabbage – have some fractal features.

Now, it’s your turn to generate some magnificent fractals!

This will be the opportunity for you to get familiar with the MiniLibX, to discover
or use the mathematical notion of complex numbers, to take a peek at the concept of
optimization in computer graphics and practice event handling.
